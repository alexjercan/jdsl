## ⇁ Installation

Soon

## ⇁ Quickstart

```console
jdsl init <URL>
jdsl run <ClassName> <FunctionName>
```

This will checkout the svn repo from URL and then it will attempt to run the
ClassName.FunctionName as the entrypoint. As I said, Tom's a genius.

### ⇁ Notes

1. Dude I am so grateful that `git` exists. Who came up with the idea that when
   you delete a file in svn it deletes it in the entire history?
